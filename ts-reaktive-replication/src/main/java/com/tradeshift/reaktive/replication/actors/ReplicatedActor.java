/**
 * An extension to {@link AbstractStatefulPersistentActor} which allows persistent actors to work across data centers and legal regions.
 * 
 * Such an actor will only accept writes in one region, and forward emitted events to other regions where they should be present.
 * 
 * Implementations must define a public, no-arguments constructor that passes in the runtime Class types of C and E.
 * 
 * The first event emitted by the first command sent to this actor MUST store the local datacenter name, and
 * EventClassifier must return that datacenter name (as first element, if multiple) when given the event.
